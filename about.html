<h1>About 'Sauglump Games'</h1>
<p>Sauglump Games is a collection of game prototypes created between 2024 and 2025. The name &quot;Sauglump&quot; is the Bavarian German variant of &quot;FUBAR&quot; - it means something is completely messed up or broken beyond repair.</p>
<p>I made about 200 game prototypes over two years, both board games and video games; all while using LLM tools extensively for brainstorming, content generation, and coding. People started asking to see and try these prototypes, so Sauglump Games exists to share, collaborate and enjoy these games together.</p>
<p>The point is getting feedback, not making money. The approach is open source - mechanics, assets, and code are available for others to use or modify. The collection includes board game prototypes with various mechanics, video game concepts, experimental rule sets, and supporting materials.</p>
<p>Most prototypes are in different stages of completion. Quality varies significantly. Some are rough concepts, others more developed. The feedback process is informal - people try games and share thoughts however works best.</p>
<p>Sauglump Games represents experimentation over commercial viability. The name captures this spirit - it's a pile of broken stuff that might contain something interesting if you dig through it.</p>
